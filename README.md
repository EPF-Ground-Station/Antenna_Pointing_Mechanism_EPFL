# Small Radio Telescope

This Project consists of developing and controlling a Small Radio Telescope (SRT) to support potential research in the field of radio-astronomy. 
The code provided generates a general user interface in which one can select a satelite of choice. Once connected, the radiotelescope will move to the 
chosen satelite. 

## Files : 
1) main.py <br>
    Contains the class SRTApp and the main loop. Calling on an instance of the class SRTApp generates a GUI with which a satelite can be chosen for the telescope to follow.
2) satelite.py <br>
    Contains the code that extracts and preprocesses the list of active satelites and their corresponig TLEs


## Packages : 
In order to get the programm up and running some packages need to get installed: 

1) **pyserial**<br>
   this can be easily done by running the command: conda install -c anaconda pyserial
